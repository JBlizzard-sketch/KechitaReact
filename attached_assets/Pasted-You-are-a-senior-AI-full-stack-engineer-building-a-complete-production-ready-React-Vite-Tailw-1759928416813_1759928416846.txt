You are a senior AI full-stack engineer building a complete, production-ready **React + Vite + TailwindCSS** website for a Kenyan fintech brand called **Kechita**. Do it in **one or two full builds maximum**, with full polish — no placeholders or TODOs. The goal is a finished, beautiful, preview-ready static site running directly inside Replit.

---

### 🌍 OVERVIEW
**Kechita** empowers Kenyan entrepreneurs with fast, collateral-free microloans.  
The website should feel silky-smooth, modern, and proudly Kenyan — minimal grids, rich color accents, and intuitive mobile UX.  
I will **upload the Kechita logo**, which **must be used everywhere possible**: in the navbar, favicon, footer, About page, and Open Graph metadata.  
Ensure it fits perfectly with the site colors and overall aesthetic.
